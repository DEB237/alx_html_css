         <p>This is my first repository. It consist of a directory called "git".</p>
         <h2>git</h2>   
        <p>The "git" directory contains other directories. They are "css", "js", and "html".</p>
         <h3>html</h3>
        <p>This directory is design to contain some html files. For example it contains the file "home.html".</p>
         <p>Directories are important as the help in organising our work. I'll probably show you more next time.</p>
